Feature: Create User
  Clients should be able to send a request to our API in order to create a user.
  Our API should also validate the structure of the payload and respond with an error if it is invalid.

  Scenario: Empty Payload @only
    If the client sends a POST request to /user with a unsupported payload, it should receive a response with a 4xx status code.

    When the client creates a POST request to /user
    And attaches a generic empty payload
    And sends the request
    Then our API should respond with a 400 HTTP status code
    And the payload of the response should be a JSON object
    And contains a message property which says "Payload should not be empty"

  Scenario: Payload using Unsupported Media Type
    If the client sends a POST request to /users with an payload that is not JSON, it should receive a response with a 415 Unsupported Media Type HTTP status code.

    When the client creates a POST request to /user
    And attaches a generic non-JSON payload
    And sends the request
    Then our API should respond with a 415 HTTP status code
    And the payload of the response should be a JSON object
    And contains a message property which says "The \"Content-Type\" header must always be \"application/json\""

  Scenario: Malformed JSON Payload
    If the client sends a POST request to /users with an payload that is malformed, it should receive a response with a 400 Unsupported Media Type HTTP status code.

    When the client creates a POST request to /user
    And attaches a generic malformed payload
    And sends the request
    Then our API should respond with a 400 HTTP status code
    And the payload of the response should be a JSON object
    And contains a message property which says "Payload should be in JSON format"
